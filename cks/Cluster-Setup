Exercise 1

Create a network policy that denies egress traffic to any domain outside of the cluster. The network policy applies to Pods with the label app=backend and also allows egress traffic for port 53 for UDP and TCP to Pods in any other namespace.
Create a Pod named allowed that runs the busybox:1.36.0 image on port 80 and assign it the label app=frontend. Make a curl call to http://google.com. The network call should be allowed, as the network policy doesnâ€™t apply to the Pod.
Create another Pod named denied that runs the busybox:1.36.0 image on port 80 and assign it the label app=backend. Make a curl call to http://google.com. The network call should be blocked.
