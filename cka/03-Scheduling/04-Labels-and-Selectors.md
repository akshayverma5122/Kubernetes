### Labels and Selectors 
- Labels and Selectors are standard methods to group things together.
- Selectors help you to filter these items
- Kubernetes uses labels to connect different objects together

### Annotation 
- While labels and selectors are used to group objects, annotations are used to record other details for informative purpose.
