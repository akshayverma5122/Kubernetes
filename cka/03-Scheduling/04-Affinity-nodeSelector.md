## Node Selectors
#### We add new property called Node Selector to the spec section and specify the label.
- The scheduler uses these labels to match and identify the right node to place the pods on.
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   nodeSelector:
    size: Large
  ```

  
- To label nodes

  Syntax
  ```
  $ kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
  ```
  Example
  ```
  $ kubectl label nodes node-1 size=Large
  ```
  
- To create a pod definition
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   nodeSelector:
    size: Large
  ```
  ```
  $ kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
  ``` 
  
## Node Selector - Limitations
- We used a single label and selector to achieve our goal here. But what if our requirement is much more complex.  
 
- For this we have **`Node Affinity and Anti Affinity`**

## Node Affinity
 
#### The primary feature of Node Affinity is to ensure that the pods are hosted on particular nodes.
- With **`Node Selectors`** we cannot provide the advance expressions.
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   nodeSelector:
    size: Large
  ```

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   affinity:
     nodeAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: size
              operator: In
              values: 
              - Large
              - Medium
  ```

  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   affinity:
     nodeAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: size
              operator: NotIn
              values: 
              - Small
  ```

  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: myapp-pod
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: data-processor
     image: data-processor
   affinity:
     nodeAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: size
              operator: Exists
  ```
